# MyRepository
My projects

This is a repository where i upload my codes that i started making since January 2023. 

sync.py-Project that syncronizes two folders: source and replica. File creation/copying/removal operations are logged to a file and to the
console output; Synchronization is performed periodically with the interval parameter in seconds; Folder paths, synchronization interval and log file path are provided
using the command line arguments; Synchronization is one-way: after the synchronization content of the replica folder is modified to exactly match content of the 
source folder.
